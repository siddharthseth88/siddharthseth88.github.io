This is basically to test out a VR Tour that I created locally on my computer. 
An output folder that's created on the desktop, contains an index.htlm file that's supposed to contain the VR tour. 
The low resolution versions of the images are in the subfolders.

Now, I want to just pull the html file into an iframe embed on my Squarespace website.

That's all.
